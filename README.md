## Launch

```
export NODE_ID=3000
go run *.go
```


## TODO

Add problems to blockchain.db as a new bucket
retrieve problem hashes
print problems from hash
nice print of graphs (maybe w javascript) and current solutions
extend max clique function to find k-clique instead
mine with solution
difficulty with solution
parallel mining with channel block to have realistic miners
