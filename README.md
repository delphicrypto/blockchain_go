# Blockchain for https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09419


## Launch

```
export NODE_ID=3000
go run *.go
```


## TODO

print problems from hash
nice print of graphs (maybe w javascript) and current solutions
extend max clique function to find k-clique instead
mine with solution
validate block to verify that given solution is better than any given before
difficulty with solution
parallel mining with channel block to have realistic miners
